# Gold Price Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of historical gold prices and relevant economic metrics using Python and Pandas. The primary goal is to extract insights from the dataset, perform various forms of analysis (including time series analysis, correlation studies, anomaly detection), and visualize trends. Additionally, advanced analysis like predictive modeling and seasonal pattern detection is carried out to forecast potential future trends in gold prices.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains historical data on gold prices along with various relevant metrics. You can access the dataset from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cvergnolle/gold-price-and-relevant-metrics).

### Key Columns:
- **Date**: The date of the record.
- **Price**: The price of gold at the given date.
- **Inflation Rate**: The inflation rate at the time.
- **Currency Exchange Rate**: The exchange rate relevant to gold prices.
- **Other Economic Metrics**: Additional economic indicators provided in the dataset.

## Analysis Performed
The analysis covers several key areas:

1. **Basic Data Exploration**:
   - Calculating basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) of gold prices.
   - Identifying unique dates and checking for missing values.
   - Analyzing the distribution and range of gold prices.

2. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - Analyzing trends in gold prices over time.
   - Calculating monthly and yearly average prices.
   - Implementing moving averages and studying volatility.
   - Assessing percentage changes in gold prices day-to-day.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Correlating gold prices with various economic metrics like inflation rates and currency exchange rates.
   - Generating a correlation matrix to visualize relationships between variables.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Plotting line graphs to show trends in gold prices.
   - Visualizing the distribution of gold prices through histograms and boxplots.
   - Exploring monthly and annual trends with visual tools.

5. **Anomalies and Outliers**:
   - Detecting outliers in gold prices and analyzing their impact.
   - Identifying significant drops or spikes in prices and their corresponding dates.
   - Finding the highest and lowest gold prices in the dataset.

6. **Advanced Analysis**:
   - Predicting future gold prices using machine learning models.
   - Analyzing the relationship between gold prices and major global events (if event data is available).
   - Detecting seasonal patterns and quarterly trends in gold prices.

7. **Aggregation and Grouping**:
   - Aggregating gold prices by year, month, and quarter.
   - Analyzing performance metrics like average percentage change and cumulative sums over time.
